My name is Sharmista (Mish) Debnath, and I'm an aspiring Building Performance Specialist with a passion for creating decarbonized, energy-efficient built environments that prioritize occupant health and comfort. Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Architecture with a specialization in High Performance Buildings at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I have well-rounded in building energy modeling, performance analysis, and sustainable design solutions. In my final semester at Georgia Tech, I'm focusing on my research which examines indoor air quality and safety of occupants in the built environment using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling techniques.

As an Energy Modeling Intern at AMPS Power Solutions - ARCO MURRAY Design Build, I worked extensively on performance optimization strategies for self-storage facilities, office buildings and multifamily projects for energy code compliance such as IECC-2021, ASHRAE 2019, and T-24 IESVE and CBECC. I also updated and built a pipeline from scratch for enhancing in-house calculation tool for solar system sizing and payback period analysis while taking the tax incentives into account to optimize renewable energy integration. Additionally, as an Energy Analyst Intern at PSI Energy Pvt. Ltd., I conducted comprehensive building performance analyses for various educational, and residential projects, using DesignBuilder for advanced load analysis, thermal comfort optimization, and daylight analysis. I successfully modelled and simulated an institutional building for GRIHA certification (equivalent to LEED). I trained new team members on designing detailed energy models ensuring seamless workflow.

As part of my undergraduate thesis, I explored energy efficient buildings and decarbonization by adjusting datasets and developed a net-zero office design that prioritize both energy performance and occupant wellbeing.

My concentration areas include detailed Building Energy Modeling, Indoor Environmental Quality, and Data-Driven Performance Optimization. I am proficient in advanced building performance analysis tools including IESVE, DesignBuilder, eQuest,CBECC, and Grasshopper plugins. I also have experience using tools and technologies such as R programming, jmp and Python (data analysis), Revit, AutoCAD, and Rhino 3D (architectural designing). 
Please take a moment to explore the different sections of my portfolio website and check out some of my highlighted projects in building performance analysis. If you have any questions or would like to reach out to me, please don't hesitate to contact me at sdebnath34@gatech.edu.
