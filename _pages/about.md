Hello! My name is Sharmista, and I’m an aspiring Building Performance Specialist with a passion for creating decarbonized, energy-efficient built environments that prioritize occupant health and comfort. I’m currently completing my Master of Science in Architecture at Georgia Institute of Technology with a specialization in High Performance Buildings. Currently, in my final semester, I’m focusing on my research on  indoor air quality and the safety of occupants in the built environment using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling techniques.

As an Energy Modeling Intern at AMPS Power Solutions - ARCO MURRAY Design Build, I worked extensively on performance optimization strategies for self-storage facilities, office buildings and multifamily projects. I successfully ensured building energy code compliance for IECC-2021, ASHRAE 2019, and T-24 using IESVE and CBECC. Additionally, I updated and built a pipeline from scratch for enhancing in-house calculation tool for solar system sizing and payback period analysis while taking the tax incentives into account to optimize renewable energy integration. 

In my role as an Energy Analyst Intern at PSI Energy Pvt. Ltd., I conducted comprehensive building performance analyses for various educational, and residential projects, using DesignBuilder for advanced load analysis, thermal comfort optimization, and daylight analysis. I successfully modelled and simulated an institutional building for GRIHA certification (equivalent to LEED) and trained new team members on creating detailed energy models ensuring seamless workflow.

My concentration areas include detailed Building Energy Modeling, Indoor Environmental Quality, and Data-Driven Performance Optimization. I am proficient in industry-standard tools, including IESVE, DesignBuilder, eQuest, CBECC, and Grasshopper plugins. I also have experience using tools and technologies such as R programming, JMP and Python for advanced data analysis.  I also leverage architectural design software like Revit, AutoCAD, and Rhino 3D to create integrated design solutions.

Please take a moment to explore the different sections of my portfolio website and check out some of my highlighted projects in building performance analysis. If you have any questions or would like to reach out to me, please don’t hesitate to contact me at [sdebnath34@gatech.edu](sdebnath34@gatech.edu).
